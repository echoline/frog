a frog can jump up to one foot in any direction.  what is the probability after N jumps that the frog is within one foot of its starting point?

so here are these three naive C programs:

	frog.c - a frog simulator

	acc.c - an accumulator that checks the landing position of the frog

	change.c - stops when the accumulator is not changing any more

and a shell script:

	frog.sh - to run all this crap for weeks and weeks

results from 1 to 12 jumps of the frog can be found in frog.dat if one does not wish to bog down one's computer, and is interested in this range of number of jumps of the frog.

there are, of course, better ways to do this...
